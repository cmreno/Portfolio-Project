            This is the original creator of our shop, Betty! She started this
            bakery back in 1945 and ran it until the day she died. Since then,
            the family has taken over the bakery and continued the legacy as she
            once did. We use the original recipes that she originally used back
            in 1945! We use her as inspiration for everything we do and hope to
            be doing her proud!
